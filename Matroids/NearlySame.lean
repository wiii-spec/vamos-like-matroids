This file provides functions to identify within a list of list of natural numbers whether or not
there is a list of natural numbers with

## Main definitions

* `NearlySameAux`: checks if there is more than one different element between two lists.
* `NearlySame`: returns a boolean on whether or not there is more than one different element between
two lists
* `elimNearlySame`: Looks at a list of lists of natural numbers and see if there are any existing
lists in the list of lists that has at most one different element between them and eliminates items
from the list of lists that have a most one different element between it and the new list.
